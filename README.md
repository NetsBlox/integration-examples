# NetsBlox Integration Examples
There are many different ways to integrate or extend NetsBlox. These include:
- Embedding NetsBlox with the embedded API
- Extending the client with extensions
- Defining custom services using the ServiceCreation service
- Hosting your own (private) RPC servers (also called service host)

Currently, this repository does not contain examples of each of these. If there is a a type of integration that interests you and there isn't an example, open an issue and we can get one added!
